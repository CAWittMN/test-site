# Parallax Circles

This is a simple interactive website that displays different-sized circles with a parallax effect. The circles move in response to mouse movement, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The closer a circle is to the viewer, the faster it moves in the opposite direction of the mouse.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the website [here]([https://your-demo-url.com](https://cawittmn.github.io/test-site/)).

## Features

- Interactive parallax effect based on mouse movement
- Smooth movement with acceleration and deceleration
- Circles blur based on their depth, giving a sense of depth of field
- Circles wrap around the screen edges, creating a seamless effect

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Move your mouse around the screen to see the circles react to the parallax effect.
- To run the website on your own server, simply host the files in your preferred web server environment.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the circles by modifying the following parameters in the `script.js` file:

- `circleCount`: The number of circles to be displayed.
- `minCircleRadius`: The minimum radius of the circles.
- `maxCircleRadius`: The maximum radius of the circles.
- `circleColors`: An array of colors to be used for the circles.
- `circleSpeedMultiplier`: Adjust this value to control the overall speed of circles.
- `roomDepth`: The depth of the room, affecting the range of circle positions.
